### Hashing with Chaining

This program allows us to :
1. Create a Hashtable.
2. Create an Element (which is a Struct in reality) to insert into the Hashtable.
3. Create a Singly Linked List composed of the Elements we've created.
4. Add Elements to the Hashtable using Separate Chaining technique.
5. Choose from three different hash functions and compare the results.
